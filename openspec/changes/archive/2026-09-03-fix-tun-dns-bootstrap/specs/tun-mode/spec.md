## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Proxy hostname resolution is bootstrapped
Before a TUN session's routes exist, the system SHALL resolve every hostname-addressed proxy node through the operating-system resolver and carry every answer, of both families, into the generated config as static host overrides, so the backend never has to resolve its own server through the tunnel it is building; each generator keeps the addresses its backend can use. Kernel-side DNS capture SHALL be armed only when the generated config actually carries an override the backend can answer with for every hostname-addressed node, because capturing port 53 while the backend still needs a name resolved sends that lookup into the tunnel. The TUN runtime SHALL be built from the same effective settings the config was generated from.

#### Scenario: Hostname node is pinned before the tunnel exists
- **WHEN** a connection starts with TUN enabled and the selected node is addressed by a hostname
- **THEN** the system SHALL resolve it through the operating-system resolver before the route helper runs, and the generated config SHALL contain a host override for that hostname

#### Scenario: Unusable answers do not count as resolved
- **WHEN** a hostname resolves only to addresses of a family xray's query strategy will not use
- **THEN** the node SHALL count as unpinned and DNS capture SHALL stay off

#### Scenario: Capture stays off when the config carries no override
- **WHEN** any hostname-addressed node has no host override in the generated config
- **THEN** the route helper SHALL be invoked without DNS capture, and the session SHALL still start

#### Scenario: Route helper and config agree
- **WHEN** a runtime profile overrides TUN settings for the connection
- **THEN** the route helper SHALL be configured from the same effective settings used to generate the config

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Privileged route helper for xray
The system SHALL include a minimal privileged helper binary that programs and removes the xray TUN routing state, because xray does not configure system routes on Linux. The helper SHALL be idempotent. `xray-up` SHALL ensure the link is up, assign the address(es) ignoring an already-present address, install a default route bound to the TUN device in a dedicated routing table (2023), and install policy rules: fwmark-255 traffic looks up `main` (pref 9000), unmarked traffic looks up `main` with the default route suppressed (`suppress_prefixlength 0`, pref 9001), and everything else looks up the TUN table (pref 9002); with `--bypass-uid`, a uid-range rule to `main` at pref 8998; with `--capture-dns`, unmarked udp and tcp traffic to port 53 looks up the TUN table (pref 8999), so a resolver on the local subnet is reached through the tunnel rather than the LAN route pref 9001 preserves. IPv6 equivalents SHALL be installed when an IPv6 address is supplied.

#### Scenario: Bring xray TUN routes up
- **WHEN** xray has created its TUN device and the helper `xray-up` is invoked with the interface name and address CIDR(s)
- **THEN** the helper SHALL bring the link up, assign the address(es), install the table-2023 default route bound to the device, and install the pref 9000/9001/9002 policy rules (plus the pref 8998 uid-range rule when `--bypass-uid` is given and the pref 8999 port-53 rules when `--capture-dns` is given), each step idempotent

#### Scenario: DNS capture excludes the backend's own queries
- **WHEN** the pref 8999 rules are installed
- **THEN** they SHALL match only unmarked traffic, so the backend's own resolver queries keep egressing the real interface through the pref 9000 rule

#### Scenario: Tear xray TUN routes down
- **WHEN** the helper `xray-down` is invoked for an interface
- **THEN** the helper SHALL remove the policy rules it owns (matching its reserved preferences), delete the device only if it is a TUN device — removing its addresses and device-scoped routes — and SHALL succeed as a no-op when both are already absent

#### Scenario: Recover leftovers after an unclean kill
- **WHEN** a previous TUN connection ended via SIGKILL and the helper `recover` is invoked for the relevant backend
- **THEN** the helper SHALL remove any leftover TUN device and its policy rules, flush its dedicated routing table (2023 for xray), and for sing-box additionally flush the routing rules and table its `auto_route` uses, leaving system networking clean
