## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: TUN mode availability per backend
The system SHALL offer TUN mode only when the selected backend is sing-box or xray. For the v2ray backend, TUN SHALL be unavailable because v2ray-core has no native TUN inbound. For xray, TUN SHALL additionally require Xray-core v26.1.13 or newer (the first release with the `tun` inbound); starting a TUN connection with an older xray SHALL fail before spawn with an error naming the installed and required versions. For xray versions in the range 26.1.13 through 26.6.22 — affected by the upstream TUN crash on quickly-closed connections (Xray-core #6364, fixed in 26.6.27) — the TUN start SHALL proceed but emit an advisory into the process log stream naming the installed version, the crash behavior, and the fixed version.

#### Scenario: v2ray backend disables TUN
- **WHEN** the selected backend is v2ray and the user opens the TUN settings page
- **THEN** the enable toggle SHALL be insensitive with an explanatory note, and no tun inbound SHALL be generated even if a stale `enabled` flag is persisted

#### Scenario: sing-box and xray expose TUN
- **WHEN** the selected backend is sing-box or xray
- **THEN** the TUN enable toggle SHALL be available, subject to the capability gate

#### Scenario: Old xray blocks TUN start with a clear error
- **WHEN** TUN is enabled and the detected xray version is older than v26.1.13
- **THEN** the connection preflight SHALL fail with an error stating the installed version and the required minimum, without spawning the backend

#### Scenario: Panic-affected xray warns but starts
- **WHEN** TUN is enabled and the detected xray version is at least 26.1.13 but older than 26.6.27
- **THEN** the connection SHALL start normally and a warning log line SHALL appear in the process logs naming the installed version, the quickly-closed-connection crash, and 26.6.27 as the fixed version
